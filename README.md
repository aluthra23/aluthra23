# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Arav Luthra  

I'm a **Computer Science** major specializing in **Data Science** at the **University of Maryland, College Park**. Iâ€™m passionate about building impactful software and leveraging **LLM technology** to solve real-world problems.  

Currently, Iâ€™m working at [**Engauge**](https://www.engauge.live/), a startup focused on engaging students in real-time during lectures by creating an interactive user interface where they can interact with peers. My role involves leveraging **LLMs** to answer student queries in real-time during lectures, utilizing **Nvidia A100 GPUs** to optimize performance. I am also deeply interested in refining and optimizing technology like this to improve its scalability and effectiveness.

Constantly exploring new technologies and methodologies to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.
